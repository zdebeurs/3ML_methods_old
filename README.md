## Background

This directory contains Machine Learning Algorithms (Bayesian Gaussian Process,
 K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines) for classifying the compact objects
  in X-ray Binaries from X-ray observations. For more details, see [our live-broadcasted talk](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mf9-_8UZLLnQyqAsFFMJeu53_0c5h8XT/view) at the SAO Astronomy Summer Intern Symposium 2019.
