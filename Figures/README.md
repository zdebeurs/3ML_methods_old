a). The non-pulsing NSs 4U1254-690, 4U1916-053, and H0614+091 (in cyan) plotted with other sources from the training set (a) NS sources (orange) and (b) BH sources (Purple).  4U1254-690, 4U1916-053, and H0614+091 have some spatial overlap with the NS sources but also has points closer to the BH than to the NSs; this could result in the misclassifications by BGP and KNN models.
