**Figure 6.** (a) The BH GRS1915+105 (in cyan) plotted together with the other BH sources in the training set (in Purple) GRS1915+105 has some spatial overlap with but also occupies a different region than most other BHs. (b). GRS1915+105 (cyan) plotted with all NS sources in the training set (orange)   GRS1915+105 has points that are closer spatially to NS sources than to other BHs; this explains the misclassification by BGP and KNN.

**Figure 7.** a). The non-pulsing NSs 4U1254-690, 4U1916-053, and H0614+091 (in cyan) plotted with other sources from the training set (a) NS sources (orange) and (b) BH sources (Purple).  4U1254-690, 4U1916-053, and H0614+091 have some spatial overlap with the NS sources but also has points closer to the BH than to the NSs; this could result in the misclassifications by BGP and KNN models.
