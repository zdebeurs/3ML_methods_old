### 44 XRB sources in Color-Color-Intensity Space

**Figure 1.** Color-Color-Intensity (CCI) diagrams of 12 black holes (purple), 20 non-pulsing neutron stars (orange), and 12 pulsar sources (green) from two different angles (35°, 145°). Each point represents two X-ray colors and the corresponding intensity over one day for a given X-ray Binary source.
