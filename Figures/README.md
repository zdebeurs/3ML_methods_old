### 33 XRB sources in Color-Color-Intensity Space

**Figure 1.** Color-Color-Intensity (CCI) diagrams of 11 BH (purple), 11 non-pulsing NS (orange), and 11 pulsar sources (green) from two different angles (0°, 180°). Each point represents two X-ray colors and the corresponding intensity over one day for a given XRB.

### XRBs that were misclassified by some of the ML algorithms

**Figure 6.** (a) The BH GRS1915+105 (in cyan) plotted together with the other BH sources in the training set (in Purple) GRS1915+105 has some spatial overlap with but also occupies a different region than most other BHs. (b). GRS1915+105 (cyan) plotted with all NS sources in the training set (orange)   GRS1915+105 has points that are closer spatially to NS sources than to other BHs; this explains the misclassification by BGP and KNN.

**Figure 7.** The BH, GRS 1739-278 (in cyan) plotted with other  sources from the training set (a) BH sources (Purple) and (b) non-pulsing NSs(orange).  GRS 1739-278 has some spatial overlap with the BH sources but also but also have points closer to the NSs than to the BHs; this could potentially explain the misclassifications by BGP, KNN and SVM models.

**Figure 8.** The non-pulsing NSs 4U1254-690, 4U1916-053, and H0614+091 (in cyan) plotted with other sources from the training set (a) NS sources (orange) and (b) BH sources (Purple).  4U1254-690, 4U1916-053, and H0614+091 have some spatial overlap with the NS sources but also has points closer to the BH than to the NSs; this could result in the misclassifications by BGP, KNN, and SVM models.
